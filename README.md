# AirHockeyProject
Two-player air hockey game, played with WASD and arrow keys.
Simple and fun design, easy to play, and of course, unfinished.
First player to get to 5 points wins! There is no Play Again button (YET.)
Planning to add sounds, but that's least priority right now.
Collisions are a little wonky, but it works for the most part!
Players can't cross the centre line (prevents cheating)
Player 1 is green and uses the WASD keys to move.
Player 2 is pink and uses the four arrow keys to move.
A point is scored when the puck (little blue thing) hits a player's net (the rectangle inside the oval).
Have fun!!!!!
